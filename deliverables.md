# Deliverables

In performance-tuning projects, clients expect a thorough audit of their database and queries, identification of bottlenecks, and tangible improvements in response time. 

Deliverables often include an analysis report of problematic SQL statements or indexing issues, a set of optimized queries/stored procedures, new or revised indexes, and a before-and-after performance comparison (e.g. “reduced report run time from 20s to 2s”).

I might also deliver query execution plan reviews and recommendations on database schema changes (such as adding indexes or refactoring queries).

Documentation of changes and performance gains is usually expected so the client can understand the improvements made.
