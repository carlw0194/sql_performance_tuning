# Tools, Skills, and Platform

Performance tuning gigs require strong T-SQL skills and deep knowledge of SQL Server internals. 

Common tools include SQL Profiler or Extended Events for tracking slow queries, the Database Engine Tuning Advisor and execution DMVs for indexing suggestions, and Query Store for analyzing historical performance. 
Freelancers often use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to examine execution plans, index usage stats, and wait statistics. 
Skills in reading execution plans and using dynamic management views are key. Knowledge of indexing strategies, query refactoring, and sometimes SQL Server Profiler/PerfMon for resource monitoring is important.
Familiarity with the clientâ€™s environment (e.g. on-premises SQL Server vs. Azure SQL Database) can also be crucial to apply the right optimizations.
